# Module 1 : Python & Statistics 

Welcome to the **Module 1** which focuses on Python and Statistics core concepts and its applications in Machine Learning. First phase would require you to learn and apply the core technologies in small scale in the form of workshops and practical hands-on and in second phase, you would work as a 'Junior Data Analyst' in **Analytics & Research** department for the client ***Blueberry Winery*** and help them launch their business. 


In this Module, you would learn basic Python & Statistics along with solving assignments at regular intervals. Mentors will guide you throughout the module and help you as you progress.

As you know, it is very important to learn 'how to google'. As we all know, we can not improve if we can not measure. Therefore, you can consider the amount of time to find a solution on google as the right parameter for measurement. So, as you grow, you should improve on it.

The key lies in the fact that you have to spend time on getting habituated with the keywords that helped you fetch the answer. Once, you know this secret of using proper keywords, you can improve your productivity drastically.

Also, as you book calendly with your mentor, you are supposed to mention the topic of discussion in a detailed manner. Many times it has been found, once you know your problem, you know your solution too. At the same time, your mentor will ask you what are the things that you have tried before asking for help. Therefore, it is advised to keep all the log files (screenshots of error message etc.) ready when you book an appointment.

## Module Overview

In this module, first you will go through the basic concepts of Python programming language. Then, you will understand the concepts of Statistics and try to apply Python programming skills on solving statistical analysis. The module has been designed to kick start a solid background in Python & Statistics. 

Later, we would discuss terminologies used in Data Analytics & Machine Learning and you would finish a handful of workshops before you start the first Project.

**Completion Time**: 5 weeks


## Resources

We would work on **GITHUB** throughout the program.

So, what is GitHub ?

**StackOverflow**

StackOverflow is a platform where you will find solutions to your queries which you would have in your day to day project work. 

It is of utmost necessity to get habituated with Stack Overflow platform and use it on a daily basis.
